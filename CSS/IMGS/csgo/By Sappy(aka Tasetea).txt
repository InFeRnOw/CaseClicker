Most weapons,skins,teams are avalible
Cool skins that dont have their own weapon folder are in the "the rest" folder in weapons
Most skins have been edited to make them pop better on screen


With MLG right around the bend I made holo team stickers icons to celebrate!
put your cans in the air and enjoy the family show!

thanks to csgo stash for having all the png. files making this process a lot easier.
Hope you guys enjoy this set, took me a fair bit of time to get all of editing and 
converting done but it was worth it. Really makes folders look cool.
